* Bug fix: In-Vantage Scripting (VantageCLoud Lake): Dropdown menus are no longer affected by the user choice of Python interpreter version for the environment the plugin operates in.
* Bug fix: In-Vantage Scripting (VantageCLoud Lake): On the APPLY Arguments screen, variable type field tooltip in the Output Variables section now displays correctly.
* Bug fix: In-Vantage Scripting (VantageCLoud Lake): On the APPLY Arguments screen, the Nulls Listing field now correctly appears once regardless the number of partitioning columns.

# Versions 3.1.11, 3.1.12 (eFix - April 2024)

* Bug fix: Analytic functions recipe: The TD_RESAMPLE function fields reflect correctly the latest changes in the function definition. 
* In-Vantage Scripting (VantageCLoud Lake): The OAF authentication method has been upgraded to utilize PAT authentication. To authenticate, users now require a UES URL, a private key PEM file, and a PAT token.
* Support for monitoring telemetry data to enhance tracking capabilities.
* Analytic Functions now allow 'Order By' functionality for Dimension type.
* The Analytic Functions recipe UI now includes a note in the Decription field. For select functions, the note highlights a best-practice reminder about specifying the schema or database name for the input table.

## Versions 3.0.11, 3.0.12 (October 2023)

* This version fully supports connections to all Teradata Vantage systems (VantageCloud Lake, VantageCloud Enterprise, and Vantage Core.)
* New feature: The In-Vantage Scripting recipe has been expanded to include using the Open Analytics Framework and the APPLY Table Operator in VantageCloud Lake systems. The recipe adjusts to the corresponding suitable interface depending on the Teradata Vantage system type where the inputs reside.
* Support for ONNX and Dataiku native model formats in BYOM recipes.
* Minor updates to some of the Analytic Functions definition JSON files.

## Versions 2.3.11, 2.3.12 (July 2023)

* Dataiku 12 is incompatible with preceding Dataiku releases. This plugin release begins support for both Dataiku 11 (or older) and 12 (and newer) releases. For as long as the plugin supports concurrently these 2 different Dataiku release families, the plugin will be using the efix version number to designate compatibility with the corresponding Dataiku release family. To this end: Releasing distinct versions for Dataiku 11 or older (v.2.3.11) and Dataiku 12 (v.2.3.12) platforms. Version 2.3.0 is otherwise identical to 2.3.11.

## Version 2.3.0 (May 2023)

* Support for the Unbounded Array Framework (UAF) time series functions.
* Bug fix: BYOM recipes did not by default run queries in TERA mode.
* Bug fix: If the user should have inadequate permissions to access a recipe, the plugin no longer produces a generic "External Code Failed" error; a permissions-related message is now issued upon accessing a recipe, instead.

## Version 2.2.1 (eFix - February 2023)

* Bug fix: An issue prevented non-admin users from running plugin recipes.

## Version 2.2.0 (December 2022)

* Support for 54 new Analytic Functions in Analytics Database 17.20.
* Bug fix: BYOM scoring recipe: Performance improvement by directly routing the scoring output to the database.

## Version 2.1.2 (eFix - October 2022)

* Bug fix: Analytic functions recipe: A naming mismatch caused errors when executing functions that use the "Number Of Splits" argument.
* Bug fix: BYOM scoring recipe: Now correctly uses the name of a Vantage table to reference the testing Dataset instead of the Dataiku Dataset name.
* Bug fix: BYOM model export recipe: Now correctly addresses the scenario where a user might choose a connection whose credentials mode is “per user”.

## Version 2.1.1 (eFix - October 2022)

* Bug fix: Analytic Functions recipe: Output Dataset is now fully qualified with database so that it can be different from the input Dataset database.
* Bug fix: Analytic Functions recipe: Execution of VAL functions now takes place on the input Dataset server.

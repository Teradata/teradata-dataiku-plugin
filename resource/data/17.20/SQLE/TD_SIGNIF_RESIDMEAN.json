The test which works off the residuals generated during the model validation / model selection processing phase.  As mentioned previously, typically the data scientists divide their series sample set into two portions: the first portion to be used for the \u201cmodel fitting\u201d exercise; and, the second portion to be used for the \u201cmodel validation\u201d exercise.  The TD_SIGNIF_RESIDMEAN function is usually executed against the residuals produced during the second \u201cmodel validation\u201d exercise, meaning against the \u201cin-sample\u201d forecasted data points.",
